                    ShoppingBuddy is a peer-to-peer delivery platform that bridges the gap between customers who need items from local stores and independent shoppers willing to help. We connect people who want to purchase from stores that don't offer delivery services with community members ready to shop and deliver for a reward.

                <h2 class="h3 mb-3">Our Story</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    ShoppingBuddy was born from recognizing a significant gap in Ireland's delivery market. While major platforms like Deliveroo and Uber Eats serve large retailers through partnerships, countless small and local stores remain excluded from delivery services. This leaves students, elderly people, busy professionals, and anyone without easy transport struggling to access these essential local businesses.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    We realized that stores like Lidl, Aldi, ethnic supermarkets, and local businesses couldn't afford delivery partnerships or dedicated drivers, yet their customers desperately needed these services. Our solution creates a win-win-win situation: customers get what they need, shoppers earn rewards for helping, and local businesses gain access to a broader customer base - all without requiring any involvement from the stores themselves.
                </p>
